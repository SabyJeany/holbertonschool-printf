project _printf

The goal of this project is to recreate the printf function, who consist to print numbers and other values stored in variables. We have developed a simplified version of printf, using Betty stylecode. Our implementation supports only the basic format specifiers : %s: prints a string %c: prints a character %d / %i : pritns an interger %%: prints the percentage symbol

The printf function processes the argument list, displays the corresponding values, and returns the total number of printed characters.
